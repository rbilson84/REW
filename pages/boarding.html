    <h1>Got a question? We’ve got you covered.</h1>
     <p>We know how important it is to feel completely confident about who’s caring for your dog. Below you’ll find answers to our most commonly asked questions about Retriever Energy Walks — from how our group walks work to safety, bookings, and what to expect on your dog’s adventures with us. If you can’t find what you’re looking for, just get in touch and we’ll be happy to help.</p>
  <div class="grid">

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Do I need to be home for you to collect my dog?</h2>
    <p>After an initial meet and greet, many clients choose to provide a spare key or lockbox code. This allows me to collect and return your dog safely while you’re out, making the whole process easy and stress-free for both you and your pet.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>How many dogs do you walk at one time?</h2>
    <p>For safety and quality of care, I walk a maximum of four dogs at any one time, in line with my insurance cover.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Can I specify a time for my dog to be walked?</h2>
    <p>I’ll always do my best to accommodate your preferred time, however this cannot be guaranteed as routes and schedules may vary from day to day.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Do you offer occasional walks?</h2>
    <p>Yes, ad-hoc walks may be available depending on current availability. Please get in touch and I’ll always do my best to accommodate you where possible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Do you charge a cancellation fee?</h2>
    <p>Yes, we kindly ask for at least 24 hours’ notice for any cancellations. Cancellations made within 24 hours of the scheduled walk will be charged at 50% of the booking fee.</p>
    <p>In the event of a severe weather warning, walks will be carried forward as a credit.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Do you offer evening and weekend walks?</h2>
    <p>Evening and weekend walks are offered on a limited basis due to other commitments and are subject to a £10 weekend surcharge. Please get in touch to check availability and I’ll do my best to help where possible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Will you walk my dog off lead?</h2>
    <p>For every new dog there is a settling-in period where all walks are kept on lead. Off-lead walking is only introduced following discussion with you and once your dog has demonstrated reliable recall and safe behaviour within the group.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Do I need to pay for my walks upfront?</h2>
    <p>Yes, payment is due at the beginning of each week or month. Cash is our preferred method of payment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>What will you do in case of an emergency?</h2>
    <p>You’ll be asked to complete a client information form that includes emergency contacts, vet details, and any important medical or care instructions. In the event of an emergency, I will act immediately in your dog’s best interests and contact you or your nominated emergency contact as soon as possible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>What happens in the event of weather warnings?</h2>
    <p>Walks will continue as normal unless conditions are deemed unsafe for travel or exercise. During extreme weather — particularly high temperatures — extra care will be taken, with modified routes, shorter sessions, and regular cooling breaks for breeds that require additional support.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="text">
    <h2>Do you offer discounts?</h2>
    <p>Yes — a 10% discount is available on block bookings of five walks or more when paid upfront.</p>
  </div>
